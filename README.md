# Nuked World - The Only World War That Pumps

## Overview

**Nuked World** is a revolutionary blockchain-based strategy game built on Solana that combines military simulation with deflationary tokenomics. Players command nations, build arsenals, and engage in strategic warfare while permanently burning $NUKED tokens with every action, creating true deflationary pressure.

**Tagline:** *"Better to nuke pixels than people."*

## Core Concept

Nuked World transforms traditional strategy gaming by integrating real economic consequences through token burning. Every military action permanently removes $NUKED tokens from circulation, making the game inherently deflationary and giving real value to strategic decisions.

## Game Mechanics

### Nation Selection & Command
- **17 Playable Nations**: Choose from major world powers including USA, China, Russia, India, UK, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Ukraine
- **Unique National Characteristics**: Each country has distinct military strength, nuclear capabilities, population, and GDP
- **Commander Identity**: Create a unique commander name to lead your chosen nation

### Military Arsenal
- **Rockets**: Primary offensive weapons (100 $NUKED per rocket)
- **Defense Systems**: Protective installations (1,000 $NUKED per system)
- **Nuclear Capabilities**: Some nations possess enhanced destructive power
- **Defense Charges**: Limited-use defensive ammunition (10 charges per defense system)

### Combat System
- **Strategic Targeting**: Attack any non-conquered nation on the interactive world map
- **Damage Calculation**: Based on rocket count, military strength, nuclear capability, and commander rank
- **Defense Interception**: Defending players can intercept incoming attacks using limited charges
- **Conquest Mechanics**: Reduce a nation's health to zero to conquer it

### Deflationary Economics
- **Token Burning**: Every purchase permanently destroys $NUKED tokens
- **Supply Reduction**: Total token supply decreases with every military action
- **Scarcity Creation**: Fewer tokens in circulation increase value for holders
- **Real Economic Impact**: Military actions have genuine economic consequences

## Commander Rank System
