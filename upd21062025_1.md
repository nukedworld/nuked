# 🕊️ Nuked World Update: Liberation Cascade System Deployed

**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Version:** v1.3.0

## 🔑 Key Features Added

### 1. Liberation Cascade on Conquest
- When a player conquers a country, the system checks if that country previously annexed others.
- **All countries sharing the original flag code** of the conquered country are restored to **independent nations**.
- Liberated countries:
  - Regain original flag and identity
  - Set to **50% health**
  - Ready to rejoin the battlefield

---

### 2. Democracy Cascade Effect
- Choosing **Democracy** after conquest now triggers the same liberation cascade.
- Rewards players with:
  - **Reputation bonus**
  - **Liberation points** (satisfaction of being a hero)
- Creates incentive for strategic, humanitarian play over raw conquest

---

### 3. Enhanced Messaging
- Success messages now clearly list all **liberated countries** via cascade
- Conquest and democracy actions include full context:
  - “You have liberated 3 nations from the grip of oppression.”
  - Instant feedback on your global impact

---

### 4. Visual & UX Improvements
- ✅ **"Liberation Cascade Effect"** info box added in conquest modal
- ✅ Democracy option updated to emphasize **freedom impact**
- ✅ Better tooltips and hover-text for new players

## ⚙️ How It Works

**During Attack:**
- Conqueror defeats a major power (e.g., Russia)
- System checks annexed territories linked via flag code
- All annexed countries are instantly restored to 50% HP and original flag
- Liberation log shown in UI

**During Democracy Choice:**
- Choosing “Democracy” triggers same cascade
- Additional rep bonus for freeing oppressed nations

## 🧠 Strategic Impact

- Conquering empire-builders like USA, Russia, or China can now **liberate entire regions**
- Humanitarian players gain **more rep, more allies**, and cleaner war logs
- Empire-builders beware: Annexation now comes with risk of **freedom backfire**

---

## 💾 Database + System
- All liberation events logged to DB
- Full error handling in place
- Cascade liberations won’t crash even if multiple layers deep

## 🌍 TL;DR
**Chain reaction of freedom** now possible.  
Take down one superpower, and their entire empire might collapse.  
Be a conqueror — or a liberator.

🧨 Nuked World — Better to nuke pixels than people.
